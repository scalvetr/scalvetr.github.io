My name is Sergi Calvet, and I am a passionate engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the software industry.

In the technology field, things changes really fast, you usually learn some new technologies or concepts just by working
(if you are lucky a lot of them). However, it might be helpful to broaden your knowledge beyond what you do at work, not just
for self-realization or the sake of learning, but to improve and bring a new insight to your company and also to boost your career.

I realized years ago that a good way to expand my knowledge (besides reading or doing trainings) is to start side projects, 
they can be small or large depending on the complexity of what you want to learn and the depth you want.

However, there are some skills or concepts that are not that technical, and the best way to learn is by doing some 
research and writing them down. This is the main reason behind starting this blog.
