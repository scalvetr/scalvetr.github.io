My name is Sergi Calvet and I am a passionate engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the software industry.

In our work it is important to be updated, and fortunately you usually learn a lot just by working. However, it's also 
important to expand your knowledge beyond what you do at work for the sake of learning new things or to boost your career.

I realized years ago that a good way to expand my knowledge (besides reading or doing trainings) is to start side projects, 
they can be small or large depending on the complexity of what you want to learn and the depth you want.

However, there are some skills or concepts that are not that technical, and the best way to learn is by doing some 
research and writing them down. This is the main reason behind starting this blog.
