My name is Sergi Calvet, and I am a passionate engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the software industry.

In the IT industry things change really fast, new libraries, frameworks, trends and even languages.
I realized from the beginning that I will be exposed to this changes by just working anyway, so it is way more fulfilling
if I establish your own way of learning, rather than passively waiting things come to modify my work or seeing them as a threat.

Reading books, trainings, regularly check webpages, forums or youtube channels is a great way to keep updated about new 
trends. Also, I want to emphasize that starting new side projects is the best way to immerse yourself in a new technology. 
This side projects can be small or large depending on the complexity of what you want to learn and the depth you want.

However, there are some skills or concepts that are not so technical and the best way to learn is by doing some
research and write. This is the main reason behind starting this blog. I really think that writing blog posts will help 
me sort things out and settle down concepts. Ideally it will also be useful for others to learn or just have a good time
reading.
